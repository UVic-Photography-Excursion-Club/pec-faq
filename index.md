# UVic Photography Excursion Club FAQ #

## General

Q: How much experience in photography do you need to join the club?  
A: None at all! We are a great learning community when it comes to everything photo related. Anything from point and shoot to DSLRs, we cover it all.

Q: I’m not really interested in photography can I still join the club?  
A: We are a photography club so having an interest in taking photos is key. If you like/want to model and take photos, then this club is for you! Instead, if you are interested in the outdoors and not so much into photography that's perfectly fine, but you might like the Outdoors Club more than ours. 

Q: How can I get involved with the club?  
A: Request to join our [member group on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/uvicpecmembers)!

Q: Do you guys only shoot digital?  
A: Some of our members do shoot with film as well and are a great resource for many questions about film if you are just getting into it. You should also check out UVic’s Photo Club which is primarily film based and for $10 a semester will get you darkroom and chemical access in the SUB.

Q: Do you have to be a UVic student to join?  
A: While we have to maintain a majority of UVic students as members, due to UVSS policy, we are open to non-Uvic students at this time.

## Fees

Q: Do you charge membership fees?  
A: We charge a $10 equipment fee. This is to help potential members who don't have access to camera equipment (it's expensive!) be able to join our club. This fee will be charged on your first excursion, added to the trip fee which goes to our volunteer drivers for gas. 

## Liability Waivers

Q: Where can I fill out a liability waiver?  
A: If you are 18 or younger, a liability waiver will be sent to you via email, after you fill out the signup form, for your parent/guardian to sign. If you are 19 or older, you can sign the waiver at the beginning of any trip.

Q: I am 18/younger can you please send the waiver to my email?  
A: Please fill out our sign up form and we will send you out the waiver after you have completed it.

Q: How do I fill out the waiver if I am 18/younger?  
A: Instruction:	
1) Please forward this email to your parent or guardian.
	2) Get them to print out the waiver.
	3) Your parent/guardian signs only where indicated on the 3rd page. No where else!
	4) Then have it scanned back to you.
	5) Print it off.
	6) Fill out only the first page. No where else!
	7) Bring it to whichever excursion you have signed up for.
8) A UVic PEC Exec must act as witness when signing the waiver.

Q: Do I sign the waiver with my parents?  
A: No, an executive has to witness your signature and sign at the same time you do. Your parents only sign the 3rd page.

Q: I have the waiver filled out and signed by my parents. How/when do I give it to you?  
A: At the beginning of any of our excursions. We still need to witness your signature.

Q: I am 19/older can you send me the waiver?  
A: Yes, but you can only fill out the first page. You still have to sign with an executive to witness it, so you can save the hassle till the beginning of any excursion you go on.

Q: Why do you require a liability waiver?  
A: Without this waiver we would not be able to operate as an excursion club under UVic and UVSS policy.

Q: Do volunteer drivers have a different waiver?  
A: Yes! It is additional to the liability waiver. Volunteer drivers under the age of 18 will have to have a parent/guardian co-sign, exactly the same process as the liability waiver.

## Excursions

Q: How often do you guys go on excursions?  
A: Almost every weekend of the fall and winter semesters, alternating Saturdays and Sundays.

Q: How do I sign up for an excursion?

Q: Does everyone who signs up make it onto the excursions?

Q: I can’t make it on trips due to my job/sports team/other commitments. Do you ever go out on other days?  
A: We do alternating trips on Saturdays and Sundays. If you can’t make it one either we do post the schedule for each semester at the beginning of a term so you can book time off to join the trips that interest you most!


Q: How do I know if I’ve made it onto this week’s trip?  
A: When the excursion form closes, we will send out an email indicating whether or not you made it on the trip. Usually this email is sent out by Wednesday, Thursday at the latest.

Q: Is there a Cancellation Policy?  
A: Due to many cancellations/no shows (the day of) on trips, we have had to implement a cancellation policy. Three cancellations/no shows (the day of the event) and you will not be admitted on an excursion for one month, no exceptions.

For drivers that are taking members as passengers, please only sign up if you know that you can be there.

## Drivers

## Camera Rental Program Info

Q: How can I rent a camera from the club?  
A: When you sign up for any club excursions (posted on our main Facebook page [fb.me/uvicpec] on the Monday before an excursion, at 8:00PM,) you can select the option to rent a camera on the excursion sign-up form. After you sign up for the excursion, we will email you a rental form to fill out. 

NOTE: If you are renting a DSLR, you must bring your student ID (or $20 if you are not a UVic Student) as collateral for borrowing the equipment. We will give back your ID or $20 when you return the equipment to us at the end of the trip. You also must fill out a Camera Rental Waiver at the beginning of the excursion if you are renting one of our DSLR cameras. (Those under 19 will need a parent/guardian signature).

Q: What cameras are available?  
A: We currently have a Canon Rebel T5, and a 18-55mm lens (we will be getting more equipment slowly, as we get more funding). We also will be selling disposable film cameras for those of you who want to use one.

Q: How is the Rental Program funded?  
A: The rental program is funded by our members! On your first excursion, we ask that you pay a $10 equipment fee. Using the money we collect from this equipment fee, we purchase cameras, lenses, memory cards and more to rent to our members who may not have the equipment themselves!

Q: Will everyone who wants to rent a camera, get a camera?  
A: No. This program will be on a first come first serve basis, and supplies are limited. The club is only able to afford so many cameras. The first member(s) to sign up and request to rent will have first pick. As there are limited DSLRs, anyone else who wishes to use a club camera may purchase a disposable film camera from us if they wish.

Q: How long do I get to keep the camera that I am renting?  
A: If you are renting a DSLR: we will give you the camera at the beginning of the excursion, and you must return the camera with all of its components (lenses, lens cap, camera strap, battery, etc.) at the end of the excursion. We will do a detailed inventory to make sure that all components of the camera are returned to us in the same condition it was given. 

If you are purchasing a disposable film camera: the camera is yours! We will give it to you at the beginning of the excursion, and you will get to take it home with you. 

Q: When do we get the camera we are renting/purchasing?  
A: We will give you the camera at the beginning of the excursion.

Q: Are there any costs involved in renting?  
A: There are no rental fees to borrow a DSLR from the club. However, if you are renting a DSLR, and you are not able to provide your own memory card, you may purchase a memory card from the club. Amount of memory (in GBs) and price for memory cards will vary (but will be around $10 each). You must bring the money for the memory card at the beginning of the excursion. You are free to use your own memory card if you have one! 

NOTE: If there are no DSLR’s available, or you want to use a disposable film camera, one can be provided (at cost) for $15. You must bring the $15 at the beginning of the excursion to receive the camera.

Q: Why do you only sell memory cards, rather than rent them out?  
A: Unfortunately we do not have the resources to rent out memory cards, as that would involve us organizing easily lost, broken or stolen memory cards, storing and uploading multiple persons’ pictures, and then sending those pictures to each corresponding person in a timely fashion. We unfortunately do not have the manpower for such a time consuming process, and for this reason, we will provide memory cards for sale only. 

Q: Do you develop and print film for the disposable cameras?  
A: We unfortunately do not have the resources or time to develop and print film. You may develop your own film at various stores in the city that offer film processing services (We recommend Prism Imaging, or London drugs), or learn to do it yourself from the UVic Photoclub (fb.me/UVicPhotoClub).
